Both random and urandom gather environmental noise from device drivers and other sources into an entropy pool. They also both keep an estimate of the number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. From this entropy pool random numbers are created.
When the entropy pool is empty, random will block until additional environmental noise is gathered while urandom will not block waiting for more entropy.
As a result, if there is not sufficient entropy in the entropy pool, the returned urandom values are theoretically vulnerable to a cryptographic attack.
